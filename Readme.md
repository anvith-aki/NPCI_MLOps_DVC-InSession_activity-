# InSession task - Data tracking/loading using DVC
  In this activity, you will learn how to use DVC (Data Version Control) to manage data efficiently. By the end of this task, you will have tracked a dataset using DVC, pushed it to remote storage (VM), and loaded the dataset into a Google Colab notebook using dvc-python-api.

## Task Overview

- Log in to your VM from your system, and create a directory inside it to act as remote storage
- Start a Codespace using this GitHub repository
- Download and Upload data to codespace using the CDN link.
- Create a Python virtual environment, and activate it
- Install required packages: dvc==3.55.2, dvc-ssh==4.1.1, asyncssh==2.18.0
-  activate and Initialize a dvc repository to track data files
- Configure the directory present on your VM as remote storage
- Track the dataset using DVC.
- Push the dataset to remote storage (VM).
- Access the dataset in a Google Colab notebook(dvc-python-api).

## Link for the dataset
 - Download the bike-sharing dataset using this  [Link](https://cdn.iisc.talentsprint.com/AIandMLOps/MiniProjects/Datasets/bike-sharing-dataset.csv) and Upload it to Codespace.
